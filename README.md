# Farmer-Goat-Wolf-Grass
A farmer wants to cross a river but he is not alone. He also has a goat, a wolf, and a grass
along with him. There is only one boat available which can support the farmer and either of
the goat, wolf or the grass. So at a time, the boat can have only two objects (farmer and one
other).
But the problem is, if the goat and wolf are left alone (either in the boat or onshore), the wolf
will eat the goat. Similarly, if the Goat and grass are left alone, then goat will eat the grass.
The farmer wants to cross the river with all three of his belongings: goat, wolf, and grass.
